  Instructions:
You are to create a web-based calculator in the browser:
1. In your HTML file, add an h1 element with the text JavaScript calculator.
2. In your HTML file, add an input element with type="number" and id="num" attribute.
3. Add a label element with appropriate text as well as a for attribute to connect the label to the input element. Implicit label
  assignment is acceptable as well.
4. Add a button element with the text Calculate!
5. Add 4 paragraphs with the text addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division .
6. Give each of the 4 paragraphs an appropriate id value.
7. Using JavaScript, build a function using a for loop, and the += operator, build a string to add 1 through 10 to whatever value the
  user has entered into the input box and assign the finalstring to the addition html paragraph.
8. Using JavaScript, build a function using a while loop, and the += operator, build a string to subtract 1 through 10 to whatever
  value the user has entered into the input box and assign the final string to the subtraction html paragraph.
9. Using JavaScript, build a function using a do while loop, and the += operator, build a string to multiply 1 through 10 to whatever
  value the user has entered into the input box and assign the final string to the multiplication html paragraph.
10. Using JavaScript, build a function using your choice of a loop construct, and the += operator, build a string to divide 1 through 10
  to whatever value the user has entered into the input box and assign the final string to the division html paragraph.
11. Use the .toFixed(2) method to return only two digits to the right of the decimal point in the division function.
12. Build a function that runs all four of the previous functions and attach it to the click event of the button. Use dynamic event
  listeners (ie. do not use the `onclick` HTML property).
13. Style your HTML with a new, linked style sheet using responsive principles and best practices.
14. Include a couple of basic media queries to make the page render well on a tablet and phone device.
15. Include an appropriate meta viewport tag in the HTML.
