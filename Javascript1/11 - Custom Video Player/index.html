  Notes from Wes Bos' video on project
    This project is mostly adding customized controls to the built in HTML5 video player.
    He added sliders for volume and play-back speed, buttons to skip forward and backwards,
      and a CSS created progress bar to allow scrubbing the video (setting the position by
      mouse click)
    I noted that in my version of FireFox, clicking on picture-in-picture sends the movie
      to the default player view with original video controls allowing easy comparison 
      for what before and after looks like.    
    Noted that my FireFox does not allow me to inspect the picture-in-picture video.
  Enhancements:
    1. Make full screen button work. (ESC restores screen)
    2. Use a button to enable/disable looping of the video.
    3. Add mute button.
    4. Add Boss Button which plays boss.mp4.
    5. Start up movie can be specified in URL with ?movie=n where n is the video number (currently only 1 or 2)
    6. Added url parameter auto=n where n > 0 to start playing the video on load (had to mute first to make it work).
